                <p>Welcome to PlainShirts, where we value not just simplicity in style but also your privacy! This page is dedicated to our cookie policy and how we handle your digital crumbs. Let’s dive in!</p>

                <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">1. The Cookie Basics</h2>
                <p>1.1 <strong>Cookie Consent:</strong> By using PlainShirts, you agree to our use of cookies. These aren&apos;t the edible kind, but they help us make your T-shirt browsing experience smoother than our softest fabric.</p>
                <p>1.2 <strong>Flavor Variety:</strong> We use different types of cookies – from essential ones that keep your cart from forgetting your tees, to analytics cookies that help us understand your style preferences. No chocolate chips, sadly.</p>

                <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">2. Managing Your Cookies</h2>
                <p>2.1 <strong>Cookie Control:</strong> Want to manage your cookie preferences? It&apos;s as easy as customizing your T-shirt. Head to our cookie settings to turn off the non-essential ones.</p>
                <p>2.2 <strong>Cookie Policy Updates:</strong> Sometimes, we might change our cookie recipe. We&apos;ll notify you about significant changes, but feel free to review this page periodically for the latest info.</p>

                <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">3. Why We Use Cookies</h2>
                <p>3.1 <strong>Seamless Experience:</strong> Cookies help us remember your preferences, so you don&apos;t have to reintroduce yourself every time you visit us. It&apos;s like having a friend who remembers your favorite tee!</p>
                <p>3.2 <strong>Improving Our Service:</strong> We analyze how you interact with our site to make your T-shirt shopping experience better. Think of it as tailoring our service to fit you perfectly.</p>

                <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">4. Your Privacy Matters</h2>
                <p>4.1 <strong>Respecting Your Choice:</strong> If you choose not to enable cookies, we respect that. Just note that some features might not work as smoothly without them.</p>
                <p>4.2 <strong>Secure and Safe:</strong> The cookies we use are as secure as our T-shirts are comfortable. We take your privacy seriously and protect your data like it’s our own.</p>

                <p>By continuing to use PlainShirts, you acknowledge that you&apos;ve read our Cookie Consent Information. If you have any cookie-related questions, or just want to chat about our latest styles, our customer service team is ready with answers and fashion tips.</p>
